# Ultimate Minimalism

> The tools you use are reflected the person you are.

Where did I start this journey? I don't know, maybe because the use of Arch Linux.

I could easily delete/uninstall the file/software I don't use or want. Later, I implement this to my life.

If I found something really annoying, throw it! If wanna make a change? Do it!

Slowly but steadily, I gave up using things like Bilibili, Youtube, Wechat, etc.

They are just tools to me.

I don't need them if I wish.

Then, this is the minimalism.
