# Two Years Experience With Arch Linux

*Posted on March 8, 2025 by Roland Su*

I've been using Arch Linux as my daily driver for two years.

## The Beginning

I started using Arch Linux in 2023, when I was in the university. At that time, I was using Windows 10, but I wanted to try something new.

As many Arch users, I switched from Windows to Ubuntu, then to Arch Linux.

## The Learning Curve

Well...at the late 2023, because of pandamic, I stayed at home, sleep the Arch Doc with me, after several weeks struggling, I finally installed Arch Linux on my pc.

I was excited when I first successfully booted it! But later I knew that I was in the dark.

It's hacky to use it. When something went wrong, the most things I did were reinstall. After a long time then I knew I could use ArchISO to fix it.

## The Customizations

> Later I realized, the tech is to solve the real world problems, not to be a geek.

Desktop Environment: GNOME -> KDE -> GNOME -> i3 -> Budgie -> i3 -> Budgie -> LXQT-> KDE

Terminal: GNOME Terminal -> Konsole -> GNOME Terminal -> Kitty -> Cursor

Browser: Firefox -> Librewolf -> Tor Browser -> Firefox -> Google Chrome -> ChatGPT

I used to very geek and privacy, and it unnecessarily wasted me too much time. Finally, efficiency is the first.

## Why Arch Linux, Still?

I love the linux terminal, and package manager, that's it.
