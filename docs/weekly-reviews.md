# Weekly Life Reviews

This is where I document my life, one week at a time. These weekly reviews help me reflect on my experiences, track my progress, and maintain perspective on my journey.

## Why Weekly Reviews?

I believe in the power of regular reflection. These weekly reviews serve several purposes:

1. **Documentation** - Capturing moments that might otherwise be forgotten
2. **Reflection** - Processing experiences and extracting lessons
3. **Gratitude** - Acknowledging the good in each week
4. **Accountability** - Tracking progress on goals and habits
5. **Perspective** - Seeing patterns and trends over time

Each review follows a similar structure to make them consistent and comparable over time.
