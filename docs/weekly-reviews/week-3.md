# Week 3: Finding My Rhythm
*March 11-17, 2025*

## Overview

Week 3 felt like things started clicking into place. After the challenges of last week, I found a better rhythm in both work and personal activities. This week was characterized by improved systems, deeper focus, and a sense of growing momentum.

## What Went Well

- Completed my first major feature at work ahead of schedule
- Established a solid 2-hour deep work block each morning with no interruptions
- Resumed progress on my personal project with renewed clarity
- Achieved perfect consistency with my morning and evening routines
- Had a breakthrough in understanding a complex technical concept I've been studying

## Challenges

- Still struggling with context switching between different projects
- Found it difficult to maintain energy levels in the late afternoon
- Received some constructive criticism that was initially hard to process
- Noticed some tension developing in team dynamics that needs addressing
- Fell behind on my reading goals for the week

## Learnings

This week provided valuable insights about my work patterns and effectiveness:

1. My productivity dramatically increases when I batch similar tasks together
2. Taking a proper lunch break away from my desk improves afternoon performance
3. Writing down thoughts before bed significantly improves sleep quality
4. Constructive criticism, while uncomfortable, contains valuable growth opportunities
5. Small daily progress compounds more effectively than sporadic intense efforts

## Gratitude

I'm grateful for:
- The sense of accomplishment from completing challenging work
- My team's recognition of my contributions
- The perfect spring weather that allowed for outdoor walks
- Technology that enables continuous learning and growth
- Moments of clarity and insight that appeared unexpectedly

## Next Week's Focus

For Week 4, I want to focus on:
1. Implementing a better system for context switching
2. Addressing team dynamics proactively through open communication
3. Finding a sustainable pace for my personal project
4. Experimenting with afternoon energy management techniques
5. Catching up on my reading backlog

## Media Consumed

- **Books**: Made progress on "Digital Minimalism" by Cal Newport
- **Articles**: "Team Dynamics in Software Development" and "Energy Management vs. Time Management"
- **Videos**: Documentary on the history of computing
- **Podcasts**: Two episodes on effective communication in technical teams
