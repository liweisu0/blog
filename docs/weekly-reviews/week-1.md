# Week 1: New Beginnings
*February 25-March 3, 2025*

## Overview

My first week of intentional weekly reviews! This week was focused on setting up new systems and starting fresh with several projects. The energy of new beginnings was palpable, though not without its challenges.

## What Went Well

- Started my new position at Joysim Technology and received a warm welcome from the team
- Successfully set up my development environment with all necessary tools
- Completed the Climate Change-Maker Hackathon with my team
- Established a morning routine that I managed to follow 5/7 days
- Read 3 chapters of "Atomic Habits" by James Clear

## Challenges

- Struggled with time management on Tuesday and Wednesday
- Found it difficult to balance work responsibilities with personal projects
- Still adjusting to the new commute, which takes more time than expected
- Missed two workout sessions due to unexpected late meetings

## Learnings

This week taught me that enthusiasm for new beginnings is powerful but needs to be channeled effectively. I learned that:

1. Setting up systems before they're needed saves tremendous time
2. Clear communication about expectations early on prevents misunderstandings
3. My energy levels peak in the morning and early afternoon
4. Having a dedicated workspace significantly improves my focus

## Gratitude

I'm grateful for:
- My supportive team members who helped me navigate my first week
- The opportunity to participate in the hackathon
- My partner's patience as I adjusted to new routines
- The sunny weather that made my commutes more pleasant

## Next Week's Focus

For Week 2, I want to focus on:
1. Establishing a more consistent workout routine
2. Diving deeper into the codebase at work
3. Setting up a better system for tracking personal projects
4. Reducing screen time in the evening by at least 30 minutes
