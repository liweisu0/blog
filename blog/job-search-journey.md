# A One-Year Story Of Me, Job Finder

*Posted on March 10, 2025 by Roland Su*

From a fresh graduate to a job seeker, here's my story.

I had a internship in Guangzhou Unicom, and at that time I served as a *Product Manager*. Later, because of the atmosphere of the company, I decided to leave and seek for a new opportunity. At that time, it was the end of 2023.

At the beginning of 2024, I started to learn Web Security from a team called *Day1*, at that time my dream was to become a Web Security Hacker, finding vulnerabilities and make money.

After 6 months of learning, I found that I was not interested in Web Security, so I decided to leave the team. The only thing I got is 1.2k RMB from AliCloud, which is from the Bug Bounty Program.

After that, I started to search for a new job, but I didn't know what I wanted to do. I applied for a lot of jobs, but I didn't get any offer.

At the end of July, 2024, I got a interview from Tencent, it's a Redis position from Tecent Game, I was really excited first, but later I fell, the recruiter told me that the resume I wrote was not good, and the learning methods had to be changed.

As I didn't know what to do, sleeping on bed in the dark rent house everyday, my dad called me and told me that there is a job in Guangzhou Joysim, then I went it. It was late November, 2024.
