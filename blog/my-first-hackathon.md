# My First Time Hackathon

*Posted on Feb 25, 2025 by Roland Su*

## The Beginning

This is hackathon that no code, and newbie friendly, which called Climate Change-Maker. We chose it for practise.

## Whole progress

At first I wanted to do solo, we are four and each one did a project. But later the organizer require us to teamup, and everyone hadn't start project yet except Du, so our project was built on hers.

This is the first time that I organize a bunch of people do the activity, of course, also other first time:
- first time to be a translator in team
- first time to know I don't know the difference of 12:30AM and 12:30PM
- first time use *Canva* to make a video

Finally, on the late night of Feb 23, we finished our project and published it on Youtube.

Thanks to my teammates, and I expect to dive in the second one!
