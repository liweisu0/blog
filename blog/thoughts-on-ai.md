# Some Thoughts On AI

*Posted on February 20, 2025 by Roland Su*

When I first used AI, it was early March in 2023. At that time, ChatGPT blowed everyone's mind on earth.

After I charged for ChatGPT Plus, the feeling is like: just a smarter chatbot, that's it.

Two years went by, two weeks before I recharge ChatGPT, the first chat just enough to blow my mind!

So, Damn, Useful!

I could practise English with it, along with other languages. Also I could do deep research with it.

I remember an embarrassing thing I did last year: when gpt came out, lots of people talked about it. It was a online chat in Tandem, while everyone were talking about how fantasy and dangerous the AI is, I said, "Well, it's ok for me because no one use AI in my life." Everyone went quiet.

Now I believe that AI could truly change the world.
